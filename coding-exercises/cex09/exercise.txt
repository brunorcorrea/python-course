Exercise: defining a method (Python 3.10)
Now that you've defined your first class, let's try to add a method into it!

As a recap, we've defined a Movie class in our previous coding exercise like this—with an __init__  method:

class Movie:
    def __init__(self, new_name, new_director):
        self.name = new_name
        self.director = new_director
Now, let's combine our previous knowledge on the print() function and try to add a method in our Movie class that formats and prints out a movie's info.

You are expected to create a method in the Movie class called print_info(). The output format of your print_info()method should look like this:

<<movie_name>> by movie_director
The movie_name and movie_director should be replaced by the according properties inside the object that calls the print_info() method.

For example, the output of the following code:

my_movie = Movie('The Matrix', 'Wachowski')
my_movie.print_info()
should look like this:

<<The Matrix>> by Wachowski
Happy coding!

P.S. Remember, you don't have to create an object or call the method—just define it inside the class!
