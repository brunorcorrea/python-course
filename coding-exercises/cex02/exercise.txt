Exercise: communicating with users (Python 3.10)
This problem has two parts:

Part 1

Ask the user for their name, and then greet them using the phrase "Hello, NAME". Of course, NAME should be replaced by the name they've given you!

Part 2

Ask the user for their age, and then print out how many months that is. You only need to print the number of months out.

Remember that for this you'll need to convert the user's input into a number by using int().
