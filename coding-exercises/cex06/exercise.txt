Exercise: FizzBuzz (Python 3.10)
I'm really excited for this challenge, and you should be too!

This is a common challenge that you could be asked to complete when you apply for graduate and entry-level programming jobs. It's not an impossible challenge—I'm sure you'll be able to do it—but it requires some careful thinking and following the instructions provided to the letter.

The FizzBuzz challenge

In this exercise, print out 100 numbers, from 1 to 100 (both inclusive). But:

Instead of printing multiples of 3, print "Fizz"

Instead of printing multiples of 5, print "Buzz"

Instead of printing multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

That means your program will print a combination of numbers, Fizz , Buzz , and FizzBuzz .

For example:

1 

2 

Fizz , since  3 is a multiple of 3

4 

Buzz , since  5 is a multiple of 5

Fizz , since  6 is a multiple of 3

7 

8 

Fizz , since  9 is a multiple of 3

Buzz , since  10 is a multiple of 5

11 

Fizz , since  12 is a multiple of 3

13 

14 

FizzBuzz , since  15 is a multiple of BOTH 3 AND 5

16 

17 

Fizz , since  18 is a multiple of 3

19 

Buzz , since 20 is a multiple of 5

Continue up to (and including) 100

Make sure your program prints from 1 to 100, both inclusive!
