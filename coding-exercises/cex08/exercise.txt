Exercise: your first Python class (Python 3.10)
This project asks you to create your first Python class!

As part of this exercise you won't have to print anything or get any user input.

Here's a representation of a movie as a dictionary:

{
  'name': 'The Matrix',
  'director': 'Wachowski'
}
How would you write this as a class, so that an object can be created like this?

my_movie = Movie('The Matrix', 'Wachowski')
Happy coding!

P.S. Remember you'll need to define an __init__  method, which needs to have two underscores at each side.
