Exercise: an improved lottery! (Python 3.10)
Welcome to this coding exercise!

For this exercise we've provided you with a list of lottery players, and also with 6 random lottery numbers.

Find out the player with the most correct numbers, and print out their winnings and their name.

The random numbers are generated in a separate file called `config.py`. You don't need to modify this file. (I know we've not looked at the import keyword yet, bear with me on that one!):

import config
 
# This line loads a set of 6 random numbers from the config file
lottery_numbers = config.lottery_numbers
And the list of players we've given you are:

players = [
    {'name': 'Rolf', 'numbers': {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11}},
    {'name': 'Charlie', 'numbers': {2, 7, 9, 21, 10, 5}},
    {'name': 'Anna', 'numbers': {13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}},
    {'name': 'Jen', 'numbers': {19, 20, 12, 7, 3, 5}}
]
Your task is to find who matched the most numbers, and print out a string with their name and the amount they won. For this exercise, assume there will only be 1 winner. Don't worry about two players matching the same amount of numbers.

For example:

Jen won 1000. 

The winnings are calculated with this formula:

winnings = 100 ** len(numbers_matched)
